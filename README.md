# MaximumOverdwarf 

While there are many infinite combos that allow you to make copies of Seven Dwarves I wanted to see what the fastest possible method was.  Looping 7 Seven Dwarves with Lumbering Battlement, a Yarok, and 8 Mirror Marches seemed cool, but there had to be a way to make dwarves faster. 

So here's a 14 card combo, not counting duplicates, that makes an insane amount of dwarves and some math explaining just how absurd the combo is.
