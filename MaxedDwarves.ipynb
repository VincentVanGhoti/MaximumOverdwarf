    " Let's start with the Mirror March triggers, it's random so how do we count number of tokens generated? We could simulate each flip and add them up, but that's a lot of headache. Because the loop will grow infinitely, it is sufficient to determine the expected of each flip. Here's the formula for calculating the expected valued of a flip: $$\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}(Trigger)} = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^i$$ \n",
